# The UK is getting drier

This animation shows changes to vegetation health and density across the UK over the past 20 years. Droughts and higher summer temperatures have become more common in the UK, and the health of vegetation in the UK clearly demonstrates that trend. Interestingly, there is some clear regional variation. Some years South-East Endland becomes markedly drier, other years the North-West of England or Wales shows clear changes in vegetation density. Northern Ireland is reliably green, likely explained by the direction of rain patterns across the UK. The most remarkable aspect of this animation is the change in vegetation in North-Western Scotland. Initially I wondered if the Scottish highlands were losing forest cover because of changes in rain patterns, or extensive logging. The white that emerges on what appear to be hill/mountain tops makes me hypothesise that snowfall is increasing in the Scottish highlands, as winters become colder. Snowcover would explain areas of white, and vegetation killed by snow and colder temperatures could explain the surrounding brown areas.
